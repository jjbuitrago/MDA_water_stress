# Water stress Analytics
This repository contains the python code and the dataset used during the project. To run the project, a *requirements.txt* file contains the python packages used in the notebook.

## Datasets
I am going to use 2 different datasets:
1. Water risk and actions https://data.cdp.net/browse?category=Water
2. https://sdg6data.org/data-lab by using the API

## The project consists of 3 parts
1. Using the UN water data to try to classify countries with a high water stress index using decision trees and ensemble models like random forests and gradient boosting
2. Using the Climate Disclosure Panel data to try to determine the water stress risks that a city may encounter
3. Using the Climate Disclosure Panel data to try to determine how the cities are tackling water stress issues

This reporting contains a _project.ipynb_ file with the code for the project, a _data_ folder with the files used and two images of decision trees that were computed
