43928,Canberra,Canberra,Australia,South Asia and Oceania,Public,,2017,Increased water stress or scarcity,Diversifying water supply (including new sources),"The ACT has mitigated short to medium-term water supply security risks by recently completing two major construction projects: 1. Construction of an enlarged Cotter Dam, completed in October 2013 at a cost of AUD$410m, has increased the ACT’s water storage capacity by 35%; and 2. Construction of the Murrumbidgee to Googong Water Transfer Pipeline, completed in September 2012 at a cost of AUD$140m.  The ACT’s long term water security is managed through day-to-day permanent water conservation measures to ensure supply through extended dry periods. The utility established these water conservation measures by basing modelling on 2030 climate change impacts. Prior to water conservation measures, Canberra’s annual water consumption averaged between 60-65 GL. Since water conservation measures were put in place, overall water consumption figures dropped to 47.8 GL during 2012-13, and 47.1 GL during 2014-15 representing a 27% saving in per capita demand relative to 1993-2002 levels. In very extended dry periods, when storage levels are low, water can be pumped from two pump stations located on the upper Murrumbidgee River. For even more protracted dry periods, when the river’s natural flows are low, extra water can be sourced through water trading and through the arranged releases from Snowy Hydro Limited’s Tantangara Reservoir as part of a portfolio of water rights already acquired. Building supply system resilience is a risk management measure. In this context, resilience includes the following: 1. a diverse range of independent water sources and demand management measures; such as accessing more reliable water catchments or less rainfall dependant sources, or implementing a range of unrelated but concurrent demand management measures. 2. system interconnectivity to take advantage of any excesses in the system; such as gridding of water sources (the Cotter Googong Bulk Water Transfer is one example of interconnectivity already in place) 3. planning flexibility; allowing implementation of the responses best suited to actual emerging futures. There is an expectation that parallel severe drought contingency plans will be prepared. Drought contingency plans comprise more short-term emergency response plans that will ensure that basic water needs for a community can be met for the duration of a very severe drought.","(-35.3075, 149.1244)","(-25.274398, 133.775136)"

In the last 20 years the city has set up protection in the form of 13 tanks preventing torrential rain from flooding the city, so that the water is gradually sent to the treatment plant after a rainy spell. The tanks have a nominal capacity of 477.020 m3.The current Drainage Master Plan of the city is the Barcelona Integral Sewer Plan (PICBA, 2006, currently in the process of revision). The elaboration of the plan is based on a Geographic Information System (following GIS) and a Modelling System (in terms of water quality and quantity). The mathematical modelling of the sewer network is a very good tool to detect flood risk areas in the city and to plan the optimal actions and needed infrastructures in order to minimize negative effects in the city during storm events.We are also working to improve the existing flood modelling System (2 dimensional, only considers capacity of the network) to a more complex  one that incorporates the behaviour of water on the surface as well.

Based on these vulnerabilities, PWD is looking at adaptation options for Philadelphia’s drinking water supply and identifying priority research needs for the future. PWD’s Delaware River Source Water Assessment identifies sea level rise as a priority concern for Philadelphia’s water supply on the Delaware. Philadelphia’s Baxter intake, which provides drinking water to nearly 1 million people, is located in the tidally influenced fresh waters of the Delaware River. PWD is currently in the process of assessing what options exist to ensure that the salty water of the tidal Delaware does not reach the Baxter intake as climate conditions change. As part of this assessment, PWD is developing modeling capabilities to not only evaluate possible sea level rise and salt intrusion scenarios, but to examine issues related to nutrient fate and transport and spill event warning as well. PWD’s Office of Watersheds implements waterway restoration programs that are designed to reduce water temperatures and stress from higher temperatures, restore aquatic ecosystems, and maintain and improve the resiliency of aquatic systems. PWD also leads multiple ongoing watershed planning efforts that are intended to improve the health of the water resources in Philadelphia watersheds while respecting the diverse needs of stakeholders. Specific investigations conducted as part of the plan development included issues related to climate change impacts, such as the affect of sea level rise and increased water salinity on aquatic vegetation.","(39.952335, -75.163789)","(37.09024, -95.712891)"

The detection of leakages must be intensified and it will be necessary to do so with new methods. The rate of renewal of the pipelines is set to increase from 1,0 % to 1,2 % per year. Approximately half of the water loss is from private owned pipelines, and the master plan suggests that VAV take the ownership and responsibility for the pipelines in public roads. While waiting on the secondary supply source, the current supply limits also implies that the specific household consumption will have to be reduced from 160 liter per day and person to 130 liter. Water meters are not mandatory in private households and only a very few households are today measuring their water consumption. The master plan has an objective to introduce water meters for all use of water and suggest making assessments concerning this.With the investments suggested to achieve the goals of the plan, the water fee for an ordinary household will be raised from ca. 1 700 NOK to ca. 4 000 NOK.","(59.9138688, 10.7522454)","(60.472024, 8.468946)"

We have since been implementing various measures under the strategy and laid a solid foundation on sustainable water management.

Water Conservation
We have been taking a multi-pronged approach to promote water conservation using both hardware and software measures, such as the “Let’s Save 10L Water” campaign. We have also been installing flow controllers at public rental housing estates, schools and government buildings. Further to the phased implementation of the Voluntary Water Efficiency Labelling Scheme (WELS) since 2009, we have launched the requirement for the mandatory use of designated products registered under WELS for all new and existing buildings under major renovation in February 2017.

Water Intelligent Network
Having achieved significant reduction in water mains leakage through the 15-year replacement and rehabilitation programme for 3,000 km aged water mains, we are progressively establishing the Water Intelligent Network (WIN) to continuously monitor network healthiness for timely and appropriate interventions to reduce water loss in the waterworks network. 

New Water Resources
We have been adopting a three-pronged approach on water supply to support the development of Hong Kong, viz using seawater for flushing purposes, importing DJ water, and collecting rainfall through natural catchment. However, with challenges arising from climate change and increasing demand for the DJ water in neighboring cities, we have been taking a responsible approach to diversify our supply sources and thereby enhance our water security for the decades to come. Apart from expanding the salt water supply system, we have been exploiting alternative water resources less susceptible to climate change including seawater desalination, reclaimed water, grey water reuse and rainwater harvesting. We have embarked on the design of a medium-sized seawater desalination plant at Tseung Kwan O, which will have output capacity capable of meeting 5-10% of Hong Kong’s fresh water demand.","(22.2880809, 114.1398015)","(22.396428, 114.109497)"
